# wasm-pack + Rust + wasm-bindgen + Vue (plus Typescript and Vite)

This template should help get you started developing WASM modules written in Rust with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite.<br>
The template uses<br>
   * Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.<br>
   * wasm-pack is used to compile Rust to WASM [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/) for more information<br>
   * Rust is a great language for codeing WASM because of it's safety and static memory control [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) <br>
   * wasm-bindgen is the control of compiling Rust to WASM [wasm-bindgen Guide](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/) and [wasm-bindgen Documentation](https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen/latest/wasm_bindgen/)<br>
   * web_sys is the glue between WASM and TypeScript/JavaScript [web_sys Guide](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/web-sys/index.html) and [web_sys Documentation](https://docs.rs/web-sys/latest/web_sys/)<br>
   * vite is the build system [Vite Dev](https://vite.dev/)
